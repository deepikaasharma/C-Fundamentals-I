Fundamentals I

It's important that you get familiar with using C# variables, if/else statements, and loops. These are the essential components you'll use to build the majority of the features of your apps. These basic assignments are to help you master some of these concepts. 

Please create a new .NET console project and finish these exercises before uploading.
Objectives

    Get familiar working in a .NET Core Console application
    Practice loops
    Practice if/else statements


1) Create a Loop that prints all values from 1-255	

2) Create a new loop that prints all values from 1-100 that are divisible by 3 or 5, but not both	

3) Modify the previous loop to print "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5	

4) (Optional) If you used "for" loops for your solution, try doing the same with "while" loops. Vice-versa if you used "while" loops!
